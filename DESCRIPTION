Title: Gene ontology enrichment using FUNC

Description: GOfuncR performs a gene ontology enrichment analysis based on
    the ontology enrichment software FUNC. GO-annotations are obtained 
    from OrganismDb or OrgDb packages ('Homo.sapiens' by default);
    the GO-graph is included in the package and updated regularly (10-Apr-2018).  
    GOfuncR provides the standard candidate vs. background enrichment analysis
    using the hypergeometric test, as well as three additional tests: 
    (i) the Wilcoxon rank-sum test that is used when genes are ranked, 
    (ii) a binomial test that is used when genes are associated with two counts and 
    (iii) a Chi-square or Fisher's exact test that is used in cases when 
    genes are associated with four counts.  
    To correct for multiple testing and interdependency of the tests, 
    family-wise error rates are computed based on random permutations 
    of the gene-associated variables.
    GOfuncR also provides tools for exploring the ontology graph and the annotations,
    and options to take gene-length or spatial clustering of genes into account.
    From version 0.99.14 on it is also possible to provide
    custom annotations and ontologies.
